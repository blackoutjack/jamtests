Did you ever want to have a set of JavaScript widgets that could
handle basic chores, such as menus (such as those above), pop-ups,
invisible sections, image management, trees, etc., without a lot of
special coding?  Ever want to have this capability be
browser-independent?  Then you know that coding these things in
JavaScript can be a major chore.  You also know that finding such code
on the web that is free, open-source, comprehensive and simple to use
is problematic.</p>

<p>There are now some developing projects that aim at a
general JavaScript application programming interface.  If you are 
interested in such sophisticated capabilities (in open-source), I 
direct your attention to 
the <a href="http://dynapi.sourceforge.net/">DynAPI project</a> and
the <a href="http://www.netwindows.org/">netWindows project</a>.
I would also direct you to
the <a href="http://jsui.sourceforge.net/">jsui project</a>,
the <a href="http://judelib.sourceforge.net/">judelib project</a> and
the <a href="http://xpdom.sourceforge.net">XPDOM project</a>,
as examples of projects that are slightly less ambitious and/or 
earlier along.  Morten's <a href="http://www.treemenu.com">JavaScript
Tree Menu</a> project is an example of one widget (trees) in a 
production-stable stage.  All of these projects are at sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>There are, obviously, other approaches that use a combination of
technologies.  One could, for example, use a combination of php and
JavaScript.  See 
the <a href="http://gml-modul.sourceforge.net">gmL-Modul
project</a> and 
the <a href="http://phplayersmenu.sourceforge.net/">PHP Layers Menu</a>
project. 
There are solutions based on a combination of Java and JavaScript.  See
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wabawt/">WAB Abstract Windows
Toolkit</a> project.</p>

<p>The code you find on this site is pure JavaScript (though I will use php
and server-side includes for my own convenience).  It is also
open source, licensed under the General Public License.
</p>

<p>
It is also, alas, in a preliminary stage of development.  I
happen to be a student at a major seminary.  My time for this project
is scarce and tends to be confined to summer months.  At the moment,
the menu code works for IE4+, Netscape 4.xx, Netscape 6+, Mozilla 1+,
Galeon 1+, Konqueror 2+ and Opera 2+.  (Netscape 4.xx support is fragile,
due to the incompatibility of Netscape 4.xx layering technology.  The
menu.js script generates &lt;layer&gt; tags when it detects a Netscape 4.xx
browser.  Your other code should do likewise.)
</p>

<p>
The first application you see is the JavaScript implementation of pull-down
menus.  These menus may be tailored according to your preferred style by
editing the styles of div.menuBar, img.menuBar, div.menuBody and
div.menuItem.  See this site&apos;s system.css file for details.  You may also
need to tweak the browser-dependent parameters in the brmenu.js script file.
These parameters are all gathered into one place, but need a good deal of
explaining.  See the documentation page (in the menu above).  They have not
been tweaked for IE4/4.5.  I noticed my tuning of IE6 was incorrect.  This 
has been fixed on this site (though not yet in the download).

<td style="color: blue;">
Font sizes can be a real problem with cross-platform portability.  I have a
laptop set up with Linux, and some of the fonts are not loaded, such as
fonts-ISO8859-7, fonts-ISO8859-7-100dpi, and fonts-ISO8859-7-type1.
When I set the font size of the menu items to 10pt, they show up as much
smaller in Mozilla 1.0.  Somehow, 12pt is more standard, in general, but
Konqueror messes up on 12pt, even with all the RedHat distribution fonts
loaded.  Go figure!  This complicates the menu code, somewhat, because
it must tailor the font size and spacing to the browser.  I have selected
10pt font for most browser/op-sys combinations, and 12pt font for 
Mozilla-based engines running under Linux because of this problem.  I have
also introduced character-width heuristics -- multiplyers for wide/narrow
characters -- in order to tighten up the width of menu blocks.
