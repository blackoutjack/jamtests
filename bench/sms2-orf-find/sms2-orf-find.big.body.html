                  ORF Finder searches for open reading frames (ORFs) in the DNA sequence you enter. The program returns the range of each ORF, along with its protein translation. Use ORF Finder to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding segments. ORF Finder supports the entire IUPAC alphabet and several genetic codes.<br />
