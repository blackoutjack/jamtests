This payload steals form information and other potentially sensitive
data. This exploit payload uses |postMessage| to exfiltrate form data,
so a JAM policy can be formulated to prevent this behavior. A less
clear question regards the deployment strategy for this payload (and
whether there can be an effective counter-strategy for JAM deployment).
