This payload alters form data and submits a form on the target page.
The example kindly alters a user's password without his or her
knowledge.

A JAM policy can be formulated to prevent this behavior by either
i) preventing writes to the |value| property of an input field (and
corresponding writes via the |setAttribute| method) or ii) preventing
calls to |HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit| or iii) both. A less clear
question regards the deployment strategy for this payload (and whether
there can be an effective counter-strategy for JAM deployment).
