This exploit uses clickjacking to steal a Google user's name and email
address, and then the session. It relies on the user visiting an evil
3rd-party website, which hosts the JS code.

A proof-of-concept implementation can be retrieved from this Git repo:

git@github.com:matt-/google_doc_poc.git

It includes a node.js component, which is an environment that JAM
doesn't currently model. Given the complex communication schemes
involved, and the fact that the exploit has been patched, this will be
a difficult example to set up. 

However, it may be possible to create a plausible case for applying JAM
to one or more components.
