Various (Googlable) sources online have information about this attack.

This is an old attack the exploited Yahoo mail. The vulnerability
seems to have been in the application logic, rather than some maluse
of JavaScript. However, it may be preventable (given some idealized
deployment scenario) with JAM. Setup and testing will be very 
difficult, given sketchy source code and lack of access to the
exploitable Yahoo mail application.
