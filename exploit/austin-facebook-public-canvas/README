This code exploits some lax rules in FBJS/FBML sandboxing of
public canvas pages provided by a malicious Facebook app. This is
one that JAM might be able to get a handle on, though it does
involve Flash (and ActionScript) also.

There seems to be a dependency missing, or the provided example is
pseudocode. At any rate, this is an exploit against FBJS, which
is obsolete, so this probably isn't a good example to target.
