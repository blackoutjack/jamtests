This zero-day exploit from August 2013 is described in various articles,
for example:

http://thehackernews.com/2013/08/Firefox-Exploit-Tor-Network-child-pornography-Freedom-Hosting.html

The code was obtained from this repository:
https://code.google.com/p/caffsec-malware-analysis/source/browse/trunk/TorFreedomHosting/


I believe it primarily exploits Firefox/Tor via JavaScript, but doesn't
really use naturally malicious JavaScript. A story might be difficult to
devise, but I can at least take a shot at disrupting the operations.
Setting up a good test case will be difficult.
